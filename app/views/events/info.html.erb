			<p id="wrap">This webapp was built to provide to prospective customers and recruiters with a demo.</p>
			<p id="wrap">It is based upon the concept of real time running, tabulating, scoring and data storage for canine scentwork trials consistings of various divisions and elements.</p>
			<h4 id="h4bold">Anticipated webapp run progression:</h4>
			<p id="wrap">Sign in or Log in (currently not controlled by admin).</p>
			<p>Create an event with division, element, search area and hide definitions and add officials and teams.</p>
			<p id="wrap">Run an event (takes you to a page providing links to team scorecards, tallies and summary tabulations).</p>
			<p id="wrap">Update scorecards and tallies during the course of the trial as overall results are tabulated.</p>
			<h4 id="h4bold">Known errors and ommisions:</h4>
			<p id="wrap">If a team or user is deleted, the user and user info or team and team info will currently be removed from all events.</p>
			<p id="wrap">Timer is not infallible and should always be backed up be other timers.</p>
			<p id="wrap">For an event, the webapp does not verify that time limits and hide counts are consistent for scorecards between teams - left to user verification.</p>
			<p id="wrap">The webapp will alert users if a search area hide count is greater than the element hide count but will not alert the user if the search area or combined search area hide counts are less than the element hide count - verification left to user.</p>
			<p id="wrap">The webapp will allow the user to enter both a false alert and a found hide for the same hide - verification left to user.</p>
			<p id="wrap">Completed scorecard and tally shade out is base upon the scorecard judge signature and use of the tally submit/update button.</p>
			<p id="wrap">The timeout checkbox is not fully controlled and should be checked before scorecard tabulation - left to user verification.</p>
			<p id="wrap">Error alerts and validation is currently minimal.</p>
